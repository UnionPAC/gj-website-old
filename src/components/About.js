          I went to school for business & finance but after graduating realized
          that I was mostly interested in building and creating things üõ† I built
          a startup called Koji Street, which was a marketplace for independent
          fashion designers and artists. I worked on that for about a year and a
          half until I felt like I was hitting a wall I couldn't overcome. I
          realized a huge issue in that startup was my lack of technical ability
          to build out product, so I decided to teach myself how to code.{" "}
          <br></br>I first learned Web Development and then decided that I
          wanted to be a builder in the CBW (Crypto, Blockchain and Web3) ü¶Ñ
          space because it was so innovative and fast paced! I have learned
          Solidity, hardhat and ethers.js, Chainlink, and many other awesome
          technologies along my way. So far, I have mainly built for EVM based
          chains like Ethereum mainnet, testnets, Polygon and more. <br></br>{" "}
          ‚≠êÔ∏è Right now my goal is to get a job in the CWB space as a Blockchain
          Developer or Solidity Engineer. Besides that I want to continue to
          solidify my Solidity & coding knowledge, work on side project ideas,
          and be more active in crypto/ web3 communities!
