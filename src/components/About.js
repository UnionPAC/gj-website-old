          Above everything else, I have a passion for creating things. I
          absolutely love the adventure and sense of satisfaction that comes
          along with the process of building; to see something come to life,
          when previously there was nothing.

          When I was little I wanted to be an inventor, but now seeing that such
          a profession is a rarity these days, I had to find my version of a
          modern inventor. For me, this was the entrepreneur or startup founder. While I
          do have certain specialized skills, I am, at heart, a generalist. I
          have always been curious and relentlessly asking why, often at the
          expense of others' sanity. Whatever the project, I take interest in
          all the elements that go into it, because to me it is important to see
          the big picture; how everything works together.

          I studied business and finance at university. Afterwards, I started my
          own business called Koji Street, which was a marketplace for
          independent artists and fashion designers. I worked on that for about
          a year and a half, and while I learned many things and made a lot of
          progress, ultimately I ended up hitting a wall I felt I wouldnâ€™t be
          able to overcome, and decided to move on.

          Since then, I have been learning web development, blockchain
          development, and various other technologies. From learning and
          building for a while now, I have taken a liking to front-end
          development. I think this is because naturally I like being able to
          see things come to life, also I really like design.

          Currently, I am working on side projects that interest me, exploring
          and staying up to date with different technologies, and am looking to
          join a team building something cool that excites me!{" "}
